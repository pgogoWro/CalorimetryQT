# CalorimetryQT for students. 
QT Creator projects + QCustomPlot library

The project of micro calorimetric simulations was made in Framework QT Creator 8.0.1 in C++ .

It consists of elements:
1. QWidget responsible for the graph (working - cosmetic corrections of the type sign the axes must be applied)

3. Lipid configuration part. In this part, the student specifies what lipid he wants to obtain, and sets the initial and final temperatures (there is an option to perform automatic temperature selection for lipids, but this was specifically omitted so that the student demonstrates his knowledge of lipid transformations). Then, after pressing the "Draw" button, the appropriate lipid is drawn from the database (the database consists of dozens of actual graphs of lipid transformations). This part works correctly, there are a few cosmetic corrections left to be applied.

5. Part of the analysis during production.
